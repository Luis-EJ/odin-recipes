# odin-recipes

In this project I will be building a recipe website to demonstrate what
I have learned, it will include a index.html file/page with links to 
the rest of the recipes. 

I will demonstrate my ability to create a website with HTML foundations 
such as working with text, adding images and linking other pages.
