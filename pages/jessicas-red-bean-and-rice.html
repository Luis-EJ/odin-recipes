    <h2>My company had a Mardi Gras party and I wanted to make a flavorful red beans and rice 
        recipe that everyone would love!</h2>

        <p>Authentic Cajun flavor! I grew up in Louisiana and love red beans and rice; these 
            are just like I remember. Serve with hot sauce for a little kick. My family loved 
            to splash a little cider vinegar in each bowl.</p>
