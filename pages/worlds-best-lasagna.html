        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until 
                well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. 
                Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, 
                fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring 
                occasionally.</li> 
            <p></p>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling 
            water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, 
            combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <p></p>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <p></p>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
            Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese 
            mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over 
            mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with 
            remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either 
            spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <p></p>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 
            25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
