    <h2>This beef chili recipe with tomato juice and beans can be made on the stove or in the slow cooker. 
        It's quick, easy, and so good.</h2>

        <p>A simple casserole with a little zing! The zing comes from the taco sauce. 
            This is a great dish for when you do not have much time to make dinner, but you want 
            something that has substance and will fill you up! You can use any kind of cheese on 
            top.</p>
